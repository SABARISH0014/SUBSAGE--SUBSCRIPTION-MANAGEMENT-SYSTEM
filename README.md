# SubSage: Your Subscription Super-Tracker! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ever signed up for a free trial and completely forgotten to cancel? Yeah, us too. SubSage is the web app that keeps your money in your pocket!

This project is your personal digital assistant for all things subscriptions. It bundles up your Netflix, Spotify, and even your utility bills into one easy-to-read dashboard.

No more stressing about due dates‚ÄîSubSage sends you email reminders so you never miss a renewal. Plus, it lets you visually see where your cash is going with cool spending charts.

It's all powered by a familiar stack: Node.js/Express.js in the back, HTML/CSS/EJS up front, and secured with modern tools like bcrypt and Google reCAPTCHA. Stop getting billed for things you don't use, and start managing your subscriptions like a boss!
